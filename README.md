# PyGWalker: A Python Library for Exploratory Data Analysis with Visualization

PyGWalker can simplify your Jupyter Notebook data analysis and data visualization workflow, by turning your pandas dataframe into a Tableau-style User Interface for visual exploration.

PyGWalker (pronounced like "Pig Walker", just for fun) is named as an abbreviation of "Python binding of Graphic Walker". 
It integrates Jupyter Notebook (or other jupyter-based notebooks) with Graphic Walker, a different type of open-source alternative to Tableau. 
It allows data scientists to analyze data and visualize patterns with simple drag-and-drop operations.

## Summary

**PyGWalker has provided one of the most interactive experiences and nicest-looking setups I have come across with EDA libraries in a Jupyter notebook. 
The interface provides an easy way for non-coders or beginner coders to start creating charts immediately.**
